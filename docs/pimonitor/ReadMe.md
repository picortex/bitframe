# PiMonitor Documentation

PiMonitor tools have been split into two major parts

- [The API](./api/ReadMe.md) (previously called the sdk-core)
- [The SDK](./sdk/ReadMe.md) (previously called the sdk-full)

These tools are all made on top of bitframe tools

- [Bitframe API](../bitframe/api/ReadMe.md)
- [Bitframe SDK](../bitframe/sdk/ReadMe.md)
