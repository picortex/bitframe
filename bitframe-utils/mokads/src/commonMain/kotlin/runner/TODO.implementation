Change this runner.

Create a RunnerService that is configurable differently on every platform,

A single service itself, can take a block of code and execute in different ways as follows

run         : Runs the code synchronously
launch      : Fires the code in a new thread and forgets
start/async : Runs the code asynchronously in a new thread and awaits for a response by return a Later/Future
